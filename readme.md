# Adding your project

[Fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/), add in
your project(s) to `repo.json` and [send us a pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)!

Each project you added should be a json object with at least one parameter -
`github_url`. You can also add an optional paramter `release_url`, which can
either be the link to the website you are hosting the project, a post where you
describes about your project, or a link to download your project release. 

Please check that the syntax is correct before sending the pull request.
